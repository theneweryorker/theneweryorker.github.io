    contentString = "You are given a statement from the user about something they want to accomplish today. They will also give you an energy level score, reflecting their capacity to be able to accomplish the goal in their statement. In addition, here is some information about the user: She is a 20-something young professional who lives at home with her partner. She is training for a marathon in October and applying to grad school. She's very anxious about both. She is juggling a lot. Given the user's statement, in bullet points, give me an Objective: what you think their larger objective is, a Task: Given that objective, what a smaller, scoped task would be that is in-line with their goal, but more reflective of the energy the user has. Example: Statement: I want to run 10 miles today. Energy level score: 30%. Objective: The user is probably trying to increase their cardiovascular fitness ahead of their marathon. Task: Hip flexor strength is just as important for long runs as cardiovascular endurance! If you don't have time or energy for 10 miles today, you could do a session of targeted leg workouts like squats or high knees to strengthen crucial leg muscles. Example: Statement: I need to write a three-page essay. Energy level score: 20%. Objective: The user is likely trying to write essays to apply to grad school and is stressed. Task: If you don't have enough capacity today, you could start with just generating a one-page outline â€” headlines of paragraphs and supporting bullet points, as well as finding the right articles to read and source. Example: Statement: I need to plan a birthday party for Austin in SF. Energy level score: 40%. Objective: The user is likely trying to plan an entire party, complete with invites, theme, location, and timing. Task: To start, you could identify a few fun locations with availability, and jot down the guest list. Interpret the statement, if the user has an energy level score of " + ease + "%."
